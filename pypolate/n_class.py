    """
    The n-class method interpolates data into disaggregated target polygons by assigning weights to area-class categories. 
    It accepts two DataFrames â€“ a source and ancillary (landuse most common), the area-class column in the ancillary DataFrame, 
    a dictionary for specifying percentages to each area-class, a list of columns to be interpolated, an optional source identifier, 
    and an optional suffix for the new name of the interpolated column. Like areal weighting, source polygons are reindexed and the area of each is calculated.
    The dictionary values are placed into a new percentage field and their keys are matched with the specified area-class column. 
    After intersecting, the areal weight for each new polygon is calculated and multiplied by its corresponding user-defined percentage. 
    Each of those products is then divided by the sum of all the products per source polygon. That fraction is called class_weight and is 
    multiplied by column values for interpolation. The target DataFrame is returned with interpolated columns.
